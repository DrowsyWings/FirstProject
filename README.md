Aqua Free is a web-based platform similar to [freewater.io](https://freewater.io), designed to offer innovative water management solutions. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), Aqua Free allows for seamless and real-time management of water resources. This platform provides users with a dashboard to monitor water distribution, track consumption, and generate reports for efficient water usage.
